        "You have a car that can drive some number of miles per gallon of fuel, and your goal is to pick a starting city such that you can fill up your car with that city's fuel, drive to the next city, refill up your car with that city's fuel, drive to the next city, and so on and so forth until you return back to the starting city with 0 or more gallons of fuel left.\n",

Since the cities are connected via a circular road, the last city is connected to the first city. In other words, the last distance in the `distances` array is equal to the distance from the last city to the first city. You'll also be given an array of fuel available at each city, where `fuel[i]` is equal to the fuel available at city `i`. The total amount of fuel available (from all cities combined) is exactly enough to travel to all cities. Your fuel tank always starts out empty, and you're given a positive integer value for the number of miles that your car can travel per gallon of fuel (miles per gallon, or MPG). You can assume that you will always be given at least two cities.\n",
