        "This problem deals with measuring cups that are missing important measuring labels. Specifically, a measuring cup only has two measuring lines, a Low (L) line and a High (H) line. This means that these cups can't precisely measure and can only guarantee that the substance poured into them will be between the L and H line. For example, you might have a measuring cup that has a Low line at `400ml` and a high line at `435ml`. This means that when you use this measuring cup, you can only be sure that what you're measuring is between `400ml` and `435ml`.\n",
        "\n",
        "You're given a list of measuring cups containing their `low` and `high` lines as well as one low integer and one high integer representing a range for a target measurement. Write a function that returns a boolean representing whether you can use the cups to accurately measure a volume in the specified `[low, high]` range (the range is inclusive).\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that:\n",
        "- Each measuring cup will be represented by a pair of positive integers `[L, H]`, where `0 <= L <= H`.\n",
        "- You'll always be given at least one measuring cup, and the `low` and `high` input parameters will always satisfy the following constraint: `0 <= low <= high`.\n",
        "- Once you've measured some liquid, it will immediately be transferred to a larger bowl that will eventually (possibly) contain the target measurement.\n",
